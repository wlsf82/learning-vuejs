## Takeaways

Bellow is a summary of some of the awesome things Vue can do:

* Make front-end code quicker to write — loading Vue in one line, mustache templates, built-in **directives**, and re-usable **components** make Vue easy to read and write
* Make front-end code easier to modify and fix — using readable mustache templates, using built-in heavily-tested **directives**, and consolidating repetitive code into components make Vue code less error-prone and easier to fix when errors do occur
* Make front-end apps fast and responsive — Vue’s use of a **Virtual DOM** makes site updates happen only when they need to and incredibly fast when they do
